This repo contains the school and personal projects. Feel free to ask me about projects I’ve done for work, as the code cannot be displayed.

FOLDERS:

Portfolio Projects – These projects are likely to be the best representation of my Machine Learning and Deep Learning abilities. Each will have a description of the context of the project at the top of top of the notebook file, or in a README.md file in the project’s own folder.

Machine Learning – Contains projects worked on during Summer 2022. These include the following models/techniques

- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Regression Assumptions
- Shrinkage Methods
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Subset Selection
- Resampling
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Boosting
- SVMs
- GLMs

Deep Learning – Currently contains FNNs, and will soon have CNN, RNN, Transformers, and more. Those projects are under way.

Data Mining – This holds only a handful of projects from an earlier class on data mining. Frankly, this is an underrepresentation of my experience in data mining and data analysis.
